Certainly! Based on your detailed responses, I've compiled a comprehensive description of the requirements for your word game app. This will serve as a blueprint for the development process and ensure that all aspects of the game are well-defined.

---

## **App Overview**

The word game is a team-based activity designed for 1 to 4 teams. Teams compete over three rounds, taking turns to guess words described by one of their teammates within a 60-second time limit. Points are awarded for correctly guessed words and deducted for certain skipped words. The team with the highest cumulative score at the end of the game wins.
